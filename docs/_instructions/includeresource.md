title: -includeresource iclause   
summary:  Include resources from the file system
---

The purpose of `-includeresource` is to fill the JAR with non-class resources. In general these come from the file system. For example, today it is very common to have these type of resources in `src/main/resources`. This pattern can easily be simulated by bnd with the `-includeresource` instruction. However, since in OSGi the packaging is so important the `-includeresource` contains a number of options to minimize files on disk and speed up things.  

The syntax of the `-includeresource` has become quite complex over time:

    -includeresource ::= iclause ( ',' iclause ) *
    iclause          ::= (unroll | copy) parameter*
    copy             ::= '{' process '}' | process
    process          ::= assignment | source
    assignment       ::= PATH '=' source
    source           ::= ('-')? PATH parameter*
    unroll           ::= '@' (PATH | URL) ( '!/' SELECTOR )?
    parameters       ::= 'flatten:' | 'recursive:' | 'filter:' | `-preprocessmatchers`

In the case of `assignment` or `source`, the PATH parameter can point to a file or directory. It is also possible to use the name.ext path of a JAR file on the classpath, that is, ignoring the directory. The `source` form will place the resource in the target JAR with only the file name, therefore without any path components. That is, including `src/a/b.c` will result in a resource `b.c` in the root of the target JAR. 

If the PATH points to a directory, the directory name itself is not used in the target JAR path. If the resource must be placed in a sub directory of the target jar, use the `assignment` form. If the file is not found, bnd will traverse the classpath to see of any entry on the classpath matches the given file name (without the directory) and use that when it matches. The `inline` requires a ZIP or JAR file, which will be completely expanded in the target JAR (except the manifest), unless followed with a file specification. The file specification can be a specific file in the jar or a directory followed by ** or *. The ** indicates recursively and the * indicates one level. If just a directory name is given, it will mean **.

The `filter:` directive is an optional filter on the resources. This uses the same format as the instructions. Only the file name is verified against this instruction.

    Include-Resource: @osgi.jar,[=\ =]
        {LICENSE.txt},[=\ =]
        acme/Merge.class=src/acme/Merge.class
    
The `-includeresources` instruction will be merged with all properties that starts with `-includeresources*`.

## Preprocessing

A clause contained in curly braces (`{` `}`) are _preprocessed_. While copying the files are run through the macro processor with the builder providing the properties. In the workspace model, all macros of the project are then available. Well known binary resources (as decided by their extension) are ignored. You can override the extension list with the `-preprocessmatchers` instruction. This must be a a selector that takes the source file name as the input. The clause can also specify a local  `-preprocessmatchers`. This selector is _prepended_ to the either the default pre process matchers or the set pre process matchers. This allows for the selection or rejection of specific files and/or extensions.

    -includeresource: {src/main/resources}, {legal=contracts}

## Ignoring Missing Sources

A _source_ in the clause starting with a `-` sign will not generare an error when the source in the clause cannot be located. This is very convenient if you specify an global `-includeresource` instruction in `build.bnd`. For example, `-includeresource.all = -src/main/resources` will not complain when a project does not have a `src/main/resources` directory. Note that the minus sign must be on the _source_. E.g. 

    `-includeresource.all = {foo=-bar}`, -foo.txt

## Unrolling

_Unrolling_ is getting the content from another JAR. It is activated by starting the source with an at sign (`@`). The at sign signals that it is not the actual file that should be copied, but the contents of that file should be placed in the destination.

    -includeresource    tmp=@jar/foo.jar

The part that follows the at sign (`@`) is either a file path or a URL. Without any extra parameters it will copy all resources except the ones in the `-donotcopy` list and the `META-INF/MANIFEST`. 

    -includeresource    @jar/foo.jar

This is an ideal way to wrap a bundle since it is a full copy. After that one can add additional resources or use `-exportcontents` to export the contained packages in the normal way. In this way, bnd will calculate all imports.

The unrolling can also be restricted with a single _selector_. The syntax for the selector must start with a `!/` marker, which is commonly used for this purpose. After the `!/` the normal selector operators and patterns can be used. For example, if we want to get just the `LICENSE` from a bundle then we can do:

    -includeresource    @jar/foo.jar!/LICENSE

However, since selectors can also negate, it is also possible to do the reverse:

    -includeresource    "@jar/foo.jar!/!LICENSE"
     
This is a single selector, it is therefore not possible to specify a chain with rejections and selections. However, also a single selector can match multiple file paths:

    -includeresource    @jar/osgi.jar!/!(LICENSE|about.html|org/*)

Wrapping often requires access to a JAR from the repository. It is therefore common to see the unrolling feature being combined with the `${repo}` macro. The `${repo}` macro is given the Bundle Symbolic Name and an optional version range returns the path to a file from the repository.

    -includeresource    @${repo;biz.aQute.bndlib}!/about.html

## Literals

For testing purposes it is often necessary to have tiny resources in the bundle. These could of course be placed on the file system but bnd can also generate these on the fly. Since these are defined in the bnd files, the content has full access to the macros. This is done by specifying a `literal` attribute on the clause.

    -includeresource    foo.txt;literal='This is some content with a macro ${sum;1,2,3}'

The previous example will create a resource with the given content.

## Flattening & Recurse

When a directory is specified bnd will by default recurse the source and create a similar hierarchy on the destination. 


The recursion and the hierarchy can be controlled with directives.

    -includeresource    target/=hierarchy/

The `recursive:` directive can be used ot indicate that the source should not be recursively traversed by specifying `false`:

    -includeresource    target/=hierarchy/;recursive:=false

In this case, only the `hierarchy` directory itself will be copied to the `target` directory.  The `flatten:` directive indicates that if the directories are recursively searched, the output must not create any directories. That is all resources are flattened in the output directory.

    -includeresource    target/=hierarchy/;flatten:=true
